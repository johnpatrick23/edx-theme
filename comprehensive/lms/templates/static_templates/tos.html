If you do not agree, you may not access or use the Services.<br>By creating an account, accepting these TOS, or by using the Services, you represent that you have either reached the age of "majority" where you live or have valid parent or legal guardian consent to be bound by these TOS. If you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help before you create an account for this website.

These TOS also limits our liability. These terms are in sections 11 and 12.</p>
    <p><b>Section 3: Privacy and Consent to Share Information</b></p>

Please read the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/default.aspx" data-mscc-ic="false">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a> as it describes the types of data Microsoft collects from you and your devices (“<b>Data</b>”) and how we use and disclose that Data. The privacy statement also describes how Microsoft uses your content, which is your communications with others; postings or feedback submitted by you to Microsoft via the Services; and the files, photos, documents, audio, digital works, and videos that you upload, store or share through the Services ("<b>Your Content</b>"). By using the Services or agreeing to these TOS, you consent to Microsoft’s collection, use and disclosure of Your Content and Data as described in the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/default.aspx" data-mscc-ic="false">Microsoft Privacy Statement.</a></p> 
    <p><b>3.2 Acknowledgment and Consent by You.</b></p>
    <p>(a) If you use your work email account to open your account for this website, you agree that Microsoft may share your usage Data for any training content and assessments accessed through the Services with your employer and you acknowledge that by agreeing to share this Data, you are allowing your employer to view reports on your usage Data.</p>

    <p><b>3.3 Data Transfer Notice.</b> Your Data and Your Content (including personal data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland) may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates or subcontractors maintain facilities. You appoint Microsoft to perform any such transfer of your Data to any such country and to store and process your Data in order to provide the Services. Microsoft abides by the EU Safe Harbor and the Swiss Safe Harbor frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.</p>
    <p><b>Section 4: Website Account, Notifications and Service Availability</b></p>
    <p><b>4.1 Website Account.</b> You must have an account for this website to access and use the Services. You may have only one (1) account for this website at a time. You agree (a) not to provide any false, inaccurate or misleading information when registering for your account, and (b) to maintain and update your account information so it remains current and accurate. You are required to sign in with your website account each time you access the Services. You may not transfer to any third party, either temporarily or permanently, any rights to access or use the Services or your account. You may not use anyone else's account to access the Services. You are solely responsible for: (a) keeping your password and account confidential, and (b) any and all activities that occur under your account. You must promptly notify Microsoft of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. Microsoft will not be liable for any loss that you incur if someone else uses your password or account, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by Microsoft or another party if someone else uses your account.</p>
    <p><b>4.2 Account Use.</b> You must use your account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a five-year period to keep your account and Services active. If you don’t sign in during this time, we may assume your account is inactive and we may close it for you. Microsoft may permanently delete your Data, Your Content and usage reports from its servers if (a) you no longer have an active account for this website, or (b) the Services are canceled, or (c) your access to the Services is terminated and Microsoft does not have any duty to provide you with Your Content, Data, or usage reports. Microsoft will not be liable for any loss or damage you may incur from the deletion of any of Your Content, Data or usage reports. If Microsoft reasonably suspects that your account is being used by a third party (for example, because of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend or terminate your account.</p>
    <p><b>4.3 Closing Your Account.</b></p> 
    <p>(a). You can close your account at any time. To close your account, please follow the instructions at the “Support” hyperlink located at the bottom of any webpage that is part of this website.</p>

First, your right to use the Services stops immediately and your license to use the software and materials related to the Services ends. Second, we may delete Your Content and the Data associated with your account or may otherwise disassociate it from you and your account (unless we are required by law to keep it). Third, you will lose access to the tools and content you’ve acquired.</p>
    <p><b>4.4 Service Notifications.</b> When there’s something important to tell you about a Service, we’ll send you notifications to the email associated with your website account.</p> 
    <p><b>4.5 Service Availability.</b> Some or all the Services (a) may be unavailable from time to time, (b) may be offered for a limited period of time, or (c) may vary depending on your region or device. We strive to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages, and Microsoft is not liable for any disruption or loss you may suffer because the Services were not available. In the event of an outage, you may not be able to retrieve your Data that you’ve stored.</p> 
    <p><b>4.6 Additional Equipment/Data Plans.</b> To use many of the Services, you’ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan.

    <p>Many of our Services allow you to store or share Your Content or receive material from others. We don’t claim ownership of Your Content. Your Content remains Your Content and you are responsible for it.</p>
    <p>When you share Your Content with other people, you understand that they may be able to, on a worldwide basis, use, save, record, reproduce, transmit, and display Your Content without compensating you. If you do not want others to have that ability, do not use the Services to share Your Content. You represent and warrant that for the duration of these TOS, you have (and will have) all the rights necessary for Your Content that is uploaded, stored, or shared on or through the Services and that the collection, use, and retention of Your Content will not violate any law or rights of others. Microsoft cannot be held responsible for Your Content or the material others upload, store or share using the Services.</b>
    <p>To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others, to protect you and the Services, and to improve Microsoft products and services, you grant to Microsoft a worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property license to use, make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, publicly display, and distribute Your Content on the Services. If you publish Your Content in areas of the Service where it is available broadly online without restrictions, Your Content may appear in demonstrations or materials that promote the Service. We do not use what you say in email, chat, video calls or voice mail, or your documents, photos or other personal files to target advertising to you. Our advertising policies are covered in detail in the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/default.aspx" data-mscc-ic="false">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Section 15: Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver if you live in the United States.</b></p> 
    <p>We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to <b>binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury</b>. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. <b>Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.</b> "We," "our," and "us" includes Microsoft and Microsoft’s affiliates.</p>
    <p><b>15.1 Disputes Covered—Everything Except IP.</b> The term "dispute" is as broad as it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, your account for this website, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, <b>except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.</b></p> 
    <p><b>15.2 Mail a Notice of Dispute First.</b> If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to <b>Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A.</b> Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. A form is available at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499" data-mscc-ic="false">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499.</a> We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.</p> 
    <p><b>15.3 Small Claims Court Option.</b> Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business your principal place of business) or King County, Washington, U.S.A. if you meet the court’s requirements.</p>
    <p><b>15.4 Arbitration Procedure.</b> The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see <a href="http://www.adr.org" data-mscc-ic="false">www.adr.org</a> or call 1-800-778-7879. To start an arbitration, submit the form available at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497" data-mscc-ic="false">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497</a> to the AAA and mail a copy to us. In a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. Any in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or if a business your principal place of business) or our principal place of business—King County, Washington if your dispute is with Microsoft. You choose. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.</p>
    <p><b>15.5 Arbitration Fees and Payments.</b></p>
    <p>(a) <b>Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less.</b> We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “<b>award</b>”), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000; (ii) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.</p>
    <p>(b) <b>Disputes Involving More than $75,000.</b> The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.</p>
    <p><b>15.6 Conflict with AAA Rules.</b> These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.</p> 
    <p><b>15.7 Must File Within One Year.</b> You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes—see section 15.1 within one year from when it first could be filed. Otherwise, it's permanently barred. </p>
    <p><b>15.8 Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.</b> You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S. Mail to the address in section 15.2. If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply.</p> 
    <p><b>15.9 Severability.</b> If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of section 15 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of section 15 still applies</p>
    <p><b>Section 16: Miscellaneous</b></p>
    <p><b>16.1 Export restrictions.</b> The Microsoft Services, including products and software and related technology are subject to U.S. export jurisdiction. You must comply with all applicable international and national, laws including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions programs, and end-user, end use and destination restrictions by the U.S. and other governments related to Microsoft products, Services and technologies. For additional information, see <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/exporting/default.aspx" data-mscc-ic="false">www.microsoft.com/exporting</a>.</p>
    <p><b>16.2 Choice of Law and Place to Resolve Disputes.</b> If you live in (or, if a business, your principal place of business is in) the United States, the laws of the state where you live govern all claims, regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the Federal Arbitration Act governs all provisions relating to arbitration. You and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in King County, Washington, for all disputes arising out of or relating to these TOS or the Services that are heard in court (excluding arbitration and small claims court).</p> 
    <p><b>16.3 Unsolicited Ideas.</b> Microsoft and its employees do not accept or consider unsolicited ideas. This includes ideas for new products, promotions, technologies, product names, product feedback and product improvements (“<b>Unsolicited Feedback</b>”). Please do not send any artwork, samples, demos, or other works to Microsoft or anyone at Microsoft. If you send any Unsolicited Feedback to Microsoft through the Services or otherwise, you acknowledge and agree that Microsoft shall not be under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to the Unsolicited Feedback.</p> 
    <p><b>16.4 Assignment.</b> Microsoft may assign, transfer or otherwise dispose our rights and obligations under these TOS, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. You may not assign, extend, sublicense or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these TOS or transfer any rights to access the Services and any attempt by you to do so is void.</p> 
    <p><b>16.5 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.</b> These TOS are solely for your and our benefit. It is not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors and assigns.</p>
